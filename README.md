# Farmer-Profiling-Project

## General info
This is a project to create a Web App that profiles Small-scale Farmers in a district into Tiers through clustering them based on selected attributes. 
It is a starting point for various stakeholders including Governments, Investors, NGOs, Cooperatives, Credit providers, Input businesses, etc to understand these farmers and make more targeted and informed decisions or investments.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with Python, Streamlit and deployed on Heroku. You can view the deployed Web App [here](https://farmer-profiling.herokuapp.com/)

## Contributing and Project Status
The App has been deployed but I am still trying to make improvements to the code so any contributions or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
